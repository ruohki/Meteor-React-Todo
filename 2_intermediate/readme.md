# Intermediate Level

Building on the basic level, this version of the todo app is much more refined. We use a package that provides an easy hook to deal with
Meteor's Tracker stuff. Also we deal with the concept of publications and subscriptions, remove the development packages (insecure and autopublish),
prevent manipulation of the todo collection on the client and moved the data mutating logic to meteor methods.
